Stocker
======

This branch is a version of Stocker that uses the Yahoo Query Language
(YQL) API. Unfortunately, at time of writing, Yahoo does not have any
official finance tables available, so there are only community-created
ones, which have an access limit. (see [this
thread](http://goo.gl/DRcN5)). Until this is supported I will be working
on a CSV version, which doesn't seem to have these limitations.
